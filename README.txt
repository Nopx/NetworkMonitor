THE STRUCTURE WAS COMPLETELY CHANGED FOR PROJECT05 SINCE IT WAS MOSTLY INDIPENDANT OF THE OTHERS

Compilation:
	To compile execute the "compile" file
	The compiled files will end up in the bin directory
Execution:
	To execute use the "execute" file
	Arguments can be appended to the "execute" file (e.g. "./execute arg0 arg1 arg2 arg3")
Arguments:
	-The arguments will be listed if execute is run without arguments
Code execution:
	-The point of entry is the IPS class
	-The class names should have self explanatory names and the code is commented
