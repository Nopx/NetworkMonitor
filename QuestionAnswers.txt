It can never be said for sure that a Disassociation or Deauthentication frame come from a malicious actor. It can always be an error or two beacons miscommunicating. If say there is a barrage of Disassociation or Deauthentication, then most of them can be assumed to be malicious, but it can never be said definitely for a single one if it is malicious or not.
One scenario could be, that the beacon is transfering data to the device and while it is transfering a Deauthentication frame arrives. As just discussed, this could be an accident. If however the data continues to be transfered, the device seems not to be deauthenticated and it becomes clear, that the Deauthentication frame was faulty.
A policy can be designed to show, not when a frame is malicious (since we do not know that), but when it is faulty.
Rules when a Disassociation/Deauthentication packet is faulty:
	-When the beacon continues to communicate normally after the packet
	-When there was no authentication/association
	-When in a 802.11w packet the checksum in the end is not correct
Both of these things are hard to judge when in a live capture.
As another measure, a Disassociation/Deauthentication can be only allowed every X minutes, to prevent wifi jamming.

WebWereld wrote in 2011, that in the Netherlands hacking Wifi and piggybacking were made legal.[1]
Interfering with a third parties data (deleting, damaging, changing, adding) is met with a maximum penalty of four years imprisonment.
Interference with systems (e.g. DOS Attack) and most unwanted interceptions of data are also illegal. Hacking into a computer is illegal, however a network is not a computer (According to Dutch jurisdiction), therefore hacking into a network is legal.[2]

Yes. All addresses in the MAC Header of the packet are a part of the MIC calculation. If one of them is changed the MIC will also change. It is therefore not possible to change a packet in transit. 
In addition to this there is a sequence number of a packet, which also is included in the calculation. This helps prevent replay attacks, since the MIC for the same packet will be different if the sequence number is different. The sequence number is 48bit long, so the only way to replay a packet is to wait for 2^48 packets and then to inject the replay. This works since the sequence number is just incremented every packet.
All this is on the basis that the key has not been compromised.
